##History

JSON is a lightweight text-based open standard data-interchange format. It is human readable. JSON is derived from a subset of JavaScript programming language (Standard ECMA-262 3rd Editionâ€”December 1999). It is entirely language independent and can be used with most of the modern programming languages.
